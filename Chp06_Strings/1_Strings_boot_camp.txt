Strings boot camp

A palindromic string is one which reads the same when it is reversed
The program below checks whether a string is palindromic.
Rather than creating a new string for the reverse of the input string, it traverses the input string forwards and backwards.
-> saving space

bool IsPalindromic(const string& s) {
    for (int i = 0, j = s.size() -1; i < j;, ++i, --j) {
        if(s[i] != s[j]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
- n is the length of the string

<Know your string libraries>
When manipulating C++ strings, you need to know the string class well.

* The basic methods are append("abc"), push_back('c'), pop_back(), insert(s.begin() + shift, "Gauss"), substr(pos, len), and compare("abc")
* Remember a string is organized like an array. It performs well for operations from the back (push_back, pop_back)
but poorly in the middle of a string (insert)
* The comparison operators <, <=, >, >= and == can be applied to strings, with == testing logical equality, 
rather than pointer equality
